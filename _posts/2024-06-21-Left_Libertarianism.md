# Left Libertarianism

Libertarianism is based on the natural right of self-ownership. However, I agree more with Christman's view, which differentiates the traditional Locke and Nozick style of ownership into self-control and income rights. Since income rights are constructed post facto in monetary form, they are not natural rights. Furthermore, the social nature of income rights places them outside the realm of self-control. Even if one disagrees with this, the traditional libertarian principle of initial acquisition in a state of nature is unverifiable. On the contrary, initial acquisition is not a one-time process; it is ongoing and often violates these principles. Therefore, libertarian distributive justice is not applicable. Under these conditions, pursuing an egalitarian form of self-ownership becomes possible.

The key lies in self-control. To achieve self-control, the crucial aspect is realizing autonomy. Humans are not static and fixed entities but are constantly changing, adapting, and fluid. In many cases, we need to think and interact with others to form a clear idea of what we want. This does not mean negotiating with others as pre-existing entities to aggregate desires, but rather developing autonomy through reflective equilibrium. Maintaining autonomy under these conditions requires the minimum ability to consider options, gather information, and engage in normal reasoning. The more we control our immediate environment, the more autonomous we are. Therefore, a person must have access to education, healthcare, and welfare conditions (such as housing), which are essential for developing autonomy.

Through these or similar means, we can achieve equal freedom, maximizing the freedom of as many people as possible rather than a few. Although this goal is distant and somewhat utopian, requiring great material abundance, autonomy itself is an open concept. Autonomy is exercised when a person can think and choose according to various aspects of their character, including desires, values, passions, and impulses, formed under conditions of authenticity. Autonomy is established when the conditions for self-reflection shape the individual's ever-changing character without creating significant internal conflict. In other words, when a person reflects on their character development and does not resist these processes, they are autonomous. From this perspective, autonomy is a very Hegelian form of self-ownership, the foundation of positive freedom.
