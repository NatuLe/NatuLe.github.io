### Social Ownership

In a participatory economy, everything needed to produce our way of life belongs to everyone equally. Individuals may own personal belongings, but the means of production are collectively owned. This includes:

1. **Natural Resources and Sinks**: The natural commons.
2. **Manufactured Artifacts**: The produced commons.
3. **Knowledge and Technology**: The information commons, including useful talents and skills.

All productive assets are treated as a joint inheritance, meaning no individual has more right to decide their use or benefit from them than anyone else. This concept of social ownership differs from state ownership and cooperative ownership, which is elaborated further in Chapter 6.

### Major Institutions

In contrast to capitalist economies, where proprietorships, limited liability corporations, and markets are the main institutions, a participatory economy relies on councils. Worker councils and neighborhood consumer councils, along with federations of these councils, coordinate their activities through a participatory planning procedure rather than central planning or market exchange.

### Worker Councils

Every worker participates in decision-making about their work environment through worker councils. Each worker has one vote, making the worker council the ultimate decision-making body in any workplace. This system ensures that all workers, regardless of seniority, have full and equal rights in the council's decisions. Large enterprises might establish smaller councils for sub-units, but this is ultimately decided by the worker council.

### Balanced Jobs

Jobs in a participatory economy are balanced to ensure equal empowerment and desirability. Unlike other economies where some jobs are inherently more desirable and empowering, job balancing committees distribute tasks to make jobs equally empowering and desirable. This system ensures that all workers have an equal opportunity to participate in decision-making and that those in less desirable jobs are compensated for their greater sacrifice.

### Neighborhood Consumer Councils

Every household in a neighborhood is part of a neighborhood consumer council, where they submit personal consumption requests, discuss neighborhood public goods, and elect delegates to higher-level federations. These councils ensure that all types of households are treated equally and have a voice in deciding on public goods at various levels, from the neighborhood to the national level.

### Federations

Neighborhood consumer councils belong to federations at city, county, state, and national levels. These federations allow people to express demands for public goods, with delegates discussing and voting on requests from their constituents. While participation is direct at the neighborhood level, it is representational at higher levels.

### Income Based on Effort and Need

Worker councils assign effort ratings to recognize that not everyone makes equal sacrifices in work. Those who make greater sacrifices receive extra consumption rights. Allowances for those who cannot work and provisions for those with special needs are established through a democratic process. The principle is that income should be based on effort or sacrifice, as well as need.

### Participatory Planning

The annual participatory planning procedure involves worker and consumer councils and federations, and an Iteration Facilitation Board (IFB). The process begins with the IFB announcing estimates of opportunity and social costs. Councils respond with consumption and production proposals, which are adjusted through iterative rounds until a feasible plan is reached. This planning ensures that the needs and contributions of all councils are balanced and coordinated.

### The Challenge

Designing a system that empowers councils while protecting broader interests is challenging. It requires giving workers and consumers autonomy without allowing unfair benefits from collective resources. Encouraging participation in decision-making, overcoming historical alienation, and ensuring that decisions are socially responsible are key challenges addressed by the participatory planning procedure. The goal is to create a system where workers and consumers have meaningful control over their economic activities and resources.
