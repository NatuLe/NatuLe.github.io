# Hahnel - 2021 - Democratic Economic Planning Part 1

## Defining goals

### On Efficiency

Efficiency is a key term in economics, often misunderstood as mere profitability. However, it encompasses more than that. While profitability focuses on financial gains, efficiency is about using resources effectively to meet needs. Economists assess efficiency through the Pareto criterion, which states that an outcome is efficient if no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off. This concept guides policies like reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which may make some worse off now but benefit many more in the future. Economists also use the efficiency criterion, a broader concept that considers whether the overall benefits to all people outweigh the costs. This criterion involves comparing the sizes of gains and losses to different people and weighing the importance of their well-being. While efficiency is crucial, it's just one aspect of a well-functioning economy, alongside considerations of justice, democracy, and sustainability.

### Economic democracy

Economic democracy is a concept often championed but not always clearly defined. It involves giving people control over their economic destinies. However, the traditional notions of economic freedom and majority rule fall short in capturing its essence. Economic freedom, while appealing, can lead to conflicts where one person's freedom impinges on another's. Similarly, majority rule can result in decisions that disproportionately affect some individuals. Instead, economic democracy should entail decision-making power in proportion to how one is affected by economic choices. This principle, known as collective economic self-management, seeks to ensure that those most affected by decisions have a proportional say in them. While achieving perfect economic self-management for everyone may be impractical, striving for it is meaningful and aligns more closely with the essence of economic democracy than simply maximizing economic freedom or relying solely on majority rule. 

###  Economic justice

The concept of a fair or equitable distribution of the burdens and benefits of economic activity is a central issue in economic justice. Various principles, or "maxims," have been proposed to guide how people should be compensated for their contributions to economic cooperation:

1. **Maxim 1:** To each according to the social value of the contribution of her human and physical capital.
2. **Maxim 2:** To each according to the social value of the contribution of only her human capital.
3. **Maxim 3:** To each according to her effort, or personal sacrifice.
4. **Maxim 4:** To each according to her need.

These maxims represent different approaches to economic justice. Maxim 1 emphasizes rewarding individuals based on the social value of their contributions, including both human and physical capital. However, it faces criticism for potentially rewarding individuals based on inherited wealth or luck, rather than merit or effort.

Maxim 2 focuses solely on rewarding individuals based on the social value of their human capital contributions. While this principle seems to align with rewarding effort, it still raises questions about the fairness of rewarding inherent talents or advantages that individuals may possess.

Maxim 3, on the other hand, emphasizes rewarding individuals based on their effort or personal sacrifice. This principle aims to balance out differences in contributions by compensating for the sacrifices individuals make for the common good. However, measuring and comparing effort and sacrifice can be challenging.

Finally, Maxim 4 suggests distributing resources according to individual need. This principle is often associated with socialist and communist ideologies, emphasizing the importance of ensuring that everyone's basic needs are met. However, determining and prioritizing needs can be complex and subjective.



###  Environmental sustainability

It took a massive movement to raise the issue of whether today’s economies are “environmentally sustainable” or on course to destroy the natural environment upon which they and we depend. However, there are numerous definitions of “sustainability” and “sustainable development,” often as varied as the people who use these terms. Some environmentalists argue that “sustainable development” has sometimes become more of a hindrance than a help to environmental protection.

### Sustainability

The concept of “sustainability” may already be implicit in the goals of efficiency, equity, and variety:

- **Efficiency:** An economy that exhausts natural resources quickly, leaving too little for future use, is inefficient.
- **Equity:** An economy that meets the luxurious demands of the present generation at the expense of the basic needs of future generations fails to achieve intergenerational equity.
- **Variety:** Replacing biodiverse tropical forests with single-species plantations destroys variety.

Given these points, it might be prudent to adopt the environmental movement's precautionary principle. This principle suggests that in cases of fundamental uncertainty with potentially large risks, it is better to be proactive. Therefore, including environmental sustainability as a goal is less risky than omitting it.

Different notions of sustainability include:

- **Weak Sustainability:** Requires leaving future generations a stock of natural and produced capital that is equally valuable to what we have today.
- **Strong Sustainability:** Requires leaving future generations a stock of natural capital that is as valuable as what we enjoy today, in addition to produced capital.
- **Environmental Sustainability:** Requires leaving future generations stocks of each important category of natural capital as large as those we enjoy today.

These definitions differ significantly. The first notion allows complete substitution between produced and natural capital. The second allows substitution within types of capital but not between natural and produced capital. The third does not allow substitution between major categories of natural capital.

In previous discussions, the following conclusions were offered:

- The natural environment provides valuable services as a resource source and waste sink.
- The regenerative capacity of environmental components and ecosystems is limited.
- Ecosystems are complex, with self-reinforcing feedback dynamics and thresholds that are difficult to pinpoint.
- Crossing important environmental thresholds can be irreversible.

Given these points, it is crucial that while meeting our economic needs fairly, democratically, and efficiently, we must not impair the ability of future generations to meet their needs. This includes preserving produced, human, and natural capital, ecosystem sink services, and technical knowledge.

Since the degree of substitutability between different kinds of capital and sink services is uncertain and some changes are irreversible, we must apply the precautionary principle regarding adequate substitutions for deteriorating conditions. Therefore, the burden of proof lies with those who argue that a deteriorating natural resource or sink service is fully and adequately substituted by another component of our legacy to future generations.

### Solidarity

By ***solidarity***,we simply mean ***concern for the well-being of others and granting others the same consideration in their endeavors as we ask for ourselves***.

This concept, akin to the “golden rule” and “categorical imperative,” is widely recognized as a powerful creator of well-being. Solidarity within families, tribes, or ethnic groups often generates well-being that surpasses what is possible through material resources alone. However, in mainstream economics, concern for others is labeled as an “interpersonal externality,” often viewed negatively, and justification is demanded for why it is a beneficial trait.

#### The Nature of Sociability

Sociability is a fundamental aspect of human nature. Our desires and goals develop through interactions with others, and one of the strongest human drives is the continuous search for respect and esteem from others. This pursuit of approval is a natural outcome of our innate sociability. Since our lives are largely joint endeavors, it is logical to seek the approval of others for our contributions to group activities. Many of our needs are best fulfilled by the actions of others, making it sensible to desire being well regarded by them.

There are two primary ways an individual can gain esteem and respect from others:

1. **Hierarchical Status:** This method grants an individual status by elevating them above others, positioning them in a status hierarchy. Esteem is gained by ranking higher than others based on established criteria. For one person to gain esteem in this way, others must lose it, creating a zero-sum game or often a negative-sum game, as the number of losers usually exceeds the number of winners.
2. **Group Solidarity:** This method guarantees individuals respect and concern for their well-being through group solidarity. Solidarity fosters a predisposition to consider others’ needs as one’s own and to value others’ diverse contributions to the group’s social endeavors. Unlike hierarchical status, solidarity is a positive-sum game.

#### The Benefits of Solidarity

Solidarity enhances the overall well-being that members of a group can achieve from a given set of scarce material resources. Economic institutions that promote feelings of solidarity are clearly preferable to those that undermine it. Solidarity is advantageous because it maximizes well-being and ensures that group members support one another in their endeavors, creating a more cooperative and fulfilling environment for all participants.

### Why not private enterprise

- *Private Enterprise Is Incompatible with Economic Self-Management*

Anti-capitalists argue that privately owned enterprises lead to "alienated labor" and prevent workers from self-managing their labor as they choose. Mainstream economists, however, reject this view, contending that competitive labor markets give workers control over the work process and its products through their supply of labor functions.

#### Mainstream Economists' Arguments

1. **Market Forces:** In competitive labor markets, workers can demand higher wages for unpleasant work or for products they deem unworthy, ensuring some control over their labor and its outcomes.
   
2. **Degrees of Self-Direction:** Different jobs offer varying degrees of self-direction, with some allowing more autonomy than others. Jobs that offer more self-management tend to have compensating differentials in wages.
   
3. **Freedom to Choose:** Individuals who value self-directed labor can become self-employed or start their own businesses. Competitive capital markets allow people to secure loans and start businesses, hiring others who are less interested in management.

4. **Consumer Influence:** Allowing individual workers more control over the work product could alienate consumers from the goods they consume, as their preferences might not align.

#### Critique of Traditional Views

- **Conflict Theory of the Firm:** This theory suggests that private enterprise economies inherently bias against worker self-management, even with competitive labor and goods markets. Employers have a vested interest in reducing employees' desire and capacity for self-managed labor to maximize profits.
  
- **Human Characteristic Transforming Effects:** Employers may favor technologies and practices that decrease employees' desire and capacity for self-managed labor over time, causing preferences for economic self-management to atrophy.

#### Theorems 8.1 and 8.2

- **Wage Bias:** Under private enterprise, labor activities that generate employee-empowering traits are underpaid, while activities that weaken these traits are overpaid, leading to an undersupply of empowering work conditions.
  
- **Snowballing Non-optimality:** The bias against self-management leads to suboptimal job mixes initially and a cumulative divergence from optimal allocations over time as individuals adjust their characteristics to favor overpaid work opportunities.

A careful analysis of the conflict theory of the firm suggests that private enterprise is fundamentally at odds with worker self-management, contrary to mainstream views that competitive markets ensure adequate worker control.

### Private enterprise is incompatible with economic justice

Private enterprise, as a system, tends to generate income distributions that may not align with what is considered fair or equitable. While it could distribute income according to the social value of one's labor and property ownership, this assumes perfect conditions such as competitive markets, zero profit rates, and no discrimination. If one believes that fairness is better described by rewarding effort or sacrifice in work, then neither private nor public enterprise market economies would provide fair outcomes by default, necessitating intervention.

#### Obstacles to Fairness in Private Enterprise Economies:

1. **Power Imbalance:** There is often a positive correlation between economic and political power, allowing those with greater income to influence policy decisions, such as tax policies, in their favor.

2. **Uncertainty and Behavioral Effects:** Policy makers must continually readjust interventions to achieve desired outcomes, which can create counterproductive effects on incentives. People may work or invest less if they anticipate higher taxes on certain types of income, reducing overall economic efficiency.

3. **Psychological Factors:** The theory of cognitive dissonance suggests that people rationalize their income as fair based on competitive pressures. They may resist interventions that redistribute income from their assets or human capital, seeing such interventions as unfair.

### The Role of a Mixed Economy

Many proponents of socialism advocate for a mixed economy, blending public and private ownership, as the ideal economic model. They argue that some level of private enterprise can coexist with socialism, fostering competition and innovation. However, critics argue that private enterprises, regardless of size or form, are incompatible with economic democracy and justice. They contend that true economic fairness can only be achieved through full social ownership of all productive resources.

#### Implications and Arguments for a Mixed Economy:

1. **Current Economic Realities:** Most economies today are already mixed, combining private and public ownership. Advocates argue that completely abolishing private enterprise would be impractical and could lead to dysfunction.

2. **Transition and Acceptance:** Transitioning to full social ownership may require a gradual approach. A mixed economy could serve as a transition period, allowing people to see the benefits of cooperatives and public enterprises before fully embracing social ownership.

3. **Development of Self-Management Skills:** Cooperative and public enterprises in a mixed economy can help develop the skills and attitudes necessary for economic self-management, which is complex and requires experience.

4. **Stimulating Innovation:** Some proponents of market socialism argue that tolerating some private enterprise can stimulate innovation. Until alternative methods are established, limited private enterprise may be necessary for this purpose.

5. **Political Feasibility:** Immediately socializing all private enterprise may be politically unfeasible. Even socialist parties rising to power through democratic means may face challenges in implementing full social ownership.

While a mixed economy may be a pragmatic approach, critics warn against its potential to regress toward more private enterprise, as seen in some European economies. They argue that ultimately, a choice must be made between incentivizing competition and greed or promoting self-management and cooperation, leading to the replacement of all private ownership with social ownership.

### Markets Are Inefficient

Professional economists widely recognize that markets allocate resources inefficiently, particularly when they are out of equilibrium, non-competitive, or involve external effects. This inefficiency is well-documented in the fundamental theorem of welfare economics. Despite this, market proponents argue that markets generally function efficiently, assuming minimal disequilibrium forces, rare non-competitive structures, and uncommon externalities. Evidence, however, suggests otherwise, and policy interventions often fall short.

#### Pervasiveness of Externalities

While markets facilitate convenient and beneficial interactions for buyers and sellers, they often lead to inefficiencies. Producers increase profits by either improving product value or reducing production discomfort. They also externalize costs onto others and internalize benefits without compensation, driven by competitive pressures. This behavior misallocates resources and reduces overall welfare. For example, car manufacturers and consumers ignore environmental damages, leading to overproduction and overconsumption of cars.

Generally, markets underprice and overproduce when negative externalities exist and overprice and underproduce when positive externalities are present. While Adam Smith's "invisible hand" praises market incentives, Professor E.K. Hunt's "invisible foot" highlights the socially counterproductive behavior driven by market forces.

#### Challenges and Inefficiencies

Market enthusiasts often overlook how firms expand profits. Expanding the economic pie is difficult, but enlarging one's share by externalizing costs is easier. This assumption underlies the belief in the beneficent invisible hand, ignoring the prevalent invisible foot.

The exclusion of affected parties from market transactions is a major source of inefficiency. When buyers and sellers externalize costs like pollution, dispersed victims face high transaction costs to organize and represent their interests. This creates a power imbalance, allowing buyers and sellers to benefit at others' expense, causing inefficiencies.

In market economies, opportunities to increase private benefits are readily available. Profit-maximizing actors exploit these opportunities, leading to significant and persistent inefficiencies.

### Wage Disparities and Market Intervention

In capitalist economies, profits earned by capitalists without active work highlight that workers are not paid wages sufficient to purchase all goods produced. However, addressing wage differences and transitioning to worker-owned enterprises raises important questions.

1. **Wage Disparities:** In labor markets, wage rates differ based on skills and contributions to output. This system rewards those with more human capital, even if their sacrifices and efforts are equal to others with less human capital, which many consider unfair.

2. **Market Socialism and Labor Markets:** Some propose eliminating labor markets while retaining markets for goods and services to address this unfairness. However, if wages are legislated to be fair while other resource allocations remain market-determined, it can lead to inefficient allocation of labor and distorted price structures.

3. **Market Dilemma:** In a market economy, there's a dilemma: either accept unfair rewards based on marginal social products in labor markets, or intervene to correct inequities, risking inefficient allocation of resources due to distorted price structures.

In conclusion, the challenge lies in finding a balance between fair compensation for labor and maintaining efficient resource allocation within market economies.

Markets and Social Bonds: A Critical Perspective
Critics argue that markets erode social values and relationships, turning everything into commodities and promoting self-interest over community well-being. This view dates back centuries and has been articulated by thinkers like Burke, Carlyle, and Marx.

Erosion of Human Values: Markets commodify everything, including virtues like love and knowledge, leading to a society focused on self-interest and cash transactions. This undermines solidarity and mutual concern among people.

Disruption of Human Relations: Markets send a message that humans cannot coordinate their activities or reach fair agreements without market mechanisms. This undermines trust and cooperation, fostering a culture of greed and fear.

Market Behavior and Greed: In market transactions, both buyers and sellers aim to maximize their own interests, often ignoring the impact on others. This disenfranchises external parties and undermines democratic principles.

Cultural and Political Impacts: Markets shape culture, influence human development, and contribute to power structures. They reward certain behaviors, like greed and passivity, while penalizing others, potentially leading to an undemocratic society.

The Market as a School: The market economy acts as a school, shaping individuals' skills and attitudes. It rewards behaviors that may not align with desirable human traits like empathy and solidarity, ultimately eroding these qualities.
## Conclusion



Contrary to common belief, free markets are highly inefficient, even when tempered by corrective policies. The challenges are substantial:

1. **External Effects:** Correcting for externalities through Pigovian taxes or subsidies is difficult and often impractical, leading to significant inefficiencies.

2. **Market Biases:** Market prices diverge from true social costs, as individuals adjust their desires to fit market biases, further distorting resource allocation.

3. **Lack of Competition:** Real markets often lack competitiveness, with insufficient anti-trust measures or regulatory interventions exacerbating inefficiencies.

4. **Market Disequilibria:** Without robust financial and industrial policies, market disequilibria worsen, leading to further efficiency losses.

5. **Empowerment Imbalance:** Market exchanges tend to benefit the wealthy over the less affluent, undermining economic and political democracy.

6. **Social Disruption:** The market system's biases and incentives erode societal bonds, promoting self-interest over community welfare.

Given these challenges, the book argues for a fundamental shift away from adversarial market negotiations towards a new approach that redefines how we coordinate economic activities. It suggests that such a shift is not only necessary but also achievable.
