The four paradigms in social theory—functionalist, interpretive, radical humanist, and radical structuralist—are built upon distinct assumptions about the nature of social science and society. Each paradigm generates unique theories, concepts, and analytical tools.

1. **Functionalist Paradigm**:
   - **Nature of Society**: Assumes society has a concrete existence and follows a certain order.
   - **Nature of Science**: Emphasizes objective and value-free social science, producing true explanatory and predictive knowledge.
   - **Goals**: Aims to provide rational explanations of social affairs, focusing on regulation and control to maintain order, equilibrium, and stability.
   - **Methodology**: Utilizes methods of natural science, mechanical and biological analogies to model social phenomena.
   - **Perspective**: Rooted in positivism, it treats the social world as concrete, where the properties of the aggregate are determined by its units.

2. **Interpretive Paradigm**:
   - **Nature of Society**: Views social reality as the result of subjective interpretations of individuals, creating a process through shared meanings.
   - **Nature of Science**: Sees scientific inquiry as influenced by human values and contexts, rejecting value-free knowledge.
   - **Goals**: Seeks to understand social reality at the level of subjective experience, emphasizing individual consciousness and shared meanings.
   - **Methodology**: Rejects the use of natural science methods, focusing on understanding social reality from the perspective of those engaged in social activities.

3. **Radical Humanist Paradigm**:
   - **Nature of Society**: Critiques the status quo, viewing society as anti-human and emphasizing human consciousness and alienation.
   - **Nature of Science**: Emphasizes the political and repressive nature of functionalist science, advocating for the demolition of such structures.
   - **Goals**: Aims to change social consciousness to enable human beings to reach their full potential, focusing on modes of domination and emancipation.
   - **Methodology**: Utilizes a holistic approach, rejecting generalizations and emphasizing the historical specificity of truth.

4. **Radical Structuralist Paradigm**:
   - **Nature of Society**: Views society as a dominating force, emphasizing structural conflict, modes of domination, and radical change.
   - **Nature of Science**: Assumes reality is objective and concrete, focusing on discovering patterns and regularities within the social world.
   - **Goals**: Committed to radical change and emancipation through political and economic crises, aiming to disrupt the status quo.
   - **Methodology**: Emphasizes the materialist view of the social world, asserting that knowledge is class-specific and ideological.

Understanding these paradigms is crucial as they outline the boundaries and approaches within which social scientists operate. Each paradigm provides a unique perspective on social phenomena, shaping the way theories are developed and applied.
